# Shift Spec Consumer

## About

This module parses the [Shift specification](https://github.com/shapesecurity/shift-spec) into a more usable form.


## Installation

```sh
npm install shift-spec-consumer
```


## Usage

```es6
let specConsumer = require("shift-spec-consumer");
let {nodes, enums, namedTypes} = specConsumer(/* contents of spec.idl */, /* contents of attribute-order.conf */);
```

The object returned by calling this module's default export appropriately has three keys: `node`, `nums`, and `namedTypes`. All are ES2015 `Map`s.

`nodes` is a map from node names (as strings) to objects of the form
```js
{attributes, children, parents}
```

where
- `attributes` is an ordered list of objects of the form `{name, type, inherited}`, where those attributes are respectively a string, a type (see below), and a boolean indicating whether this field is inherited.
- `children` is a list of names of nodes which descend from this node
- `parents` is a list of names of nodes from which this node descends.

`enums` is a map from names to lists of strings, which were enums in the spec.

`namedTypes` is a map from type names to types (see below).

A `type` is a two-key object `{kind, argument}`, where
- `kind` is one of `'nullable', 'union', 'list', 'value', 'node', 'enum', 'namedType'`
- `argument` depends on `kind`. For
  - `nullable` it is a type
  - `union` it is a list of types
  - `list` it is a type
  - `value` it is one of `'string', 'boolean', 'double'`
  - `node` it is a key in `nodes`
  - `enum` it is a key in `nums`
  - `namedType` it is a key in `namedTypes`.
